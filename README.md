# Space-Invaders 
Space Invaders created in Python ðŸ‘¾

Description of the game:

Somewhere, in the endless cosmos, a war is taking place between 5 malicious aliens and a brave guardian of the planet Pythonale. 
You have to distroy all 5 space invaders. If they touch you, you'll die and the game will end. No extra lives (maybe in a future version).

This game was created with classes and objects.

Purpose: learning OOP in Python (and having fun)
